# UpdateDocument Bug Fix - QA Test Report

**Test Date:** October 22, 2025, 10:03-10:05 UTC
**Test Environment:** Backend server with UpdateDocument bug fix deployed
**Tester:** QA Automation
**Bug Report:** Content field being overwritten with null when updating document without content field
**Status:** PASSED - Bug Fix Verified and Working

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BUG FIX CONFIRMED:** The UpdateDocument endpoint bug has been successfully fixed. Previously, when updating a document's title or status without including the content field in the request, the content would be overwritten with null. This critical data loss bug is now resolved.

**Test Result:** All content preservation tests passed. The fix is production-ready.

**Deployment Status:** APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

---

## Bug Description

**Original Issue:**
- When calling `PUT /api/v1/documents/{id}` with only title/status fields (without content)
- The document's content field was being set to null in the database
- This caused permanent data loss of AI-generated resume/cover letter content

**Expected Behavior:**
- Updating only title/status should preserve existing content
- Content should only change when explicitly included in the request

**Fix Verification:**
- Content is now preserved when not included in update request
- Partial updates work correctly (can update only title, only status, or any combination)
- Explicit content updates still work as expected

## Detailed Test Results

### Test Environment Setup

**Note:** The test user (test@example.com) had exhausted their free generation quota (0 remaining). Therefore, testing was performed using an existing document with manually added test content rather than a newly generated document. This approach still validates the bug fix effectively.

**Test Document ID:** `da3c511f-99b0-4f95-84e0-e1e10970a5d0`

---

### Step 1: Authentication

**Test Case:** Login and obtain access token
**Status:** PASS

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!"
}
```

**Result:**
- HTTP Status: 200 OK
- Access token received
- User ID: `7d892ba0-9f54-4181-a4c3-c59b1e478e9e`
- Free generations left: 0 (quota exhausted)

---

### Step 2: Check User Quota

**Test Case:** Verify user's generation quota status
**Status:** PASS

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/user/me`

**Result:**
```json
{
  "id": "7d892ba0-9f54-4181-a4c3-c59b1e478e9e",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "full_name": "Test User",
  "free_generations_left": 0,
  "is_premium": false
}
```

**Decision:** Use existing document and add test content manually instead of generating new document.

---

### Step 3: Add Test Content to Existing Document

**Test Case:** Populate document with test content
**Status:** PASS

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/documents/da3c511f-99b0-4f95-84e0-e1e10970a5d0`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "summary": "Experienced Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years specializing in Go microservices, distributed systems, and PostgreSQL database design. Proven track record of building scalable architectures and mentoring development teams.",
    "experience": [
      {
        "title": "Senior Backend Engineer",
        "company": "TechCorp",
        "duration": "2020-Present",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Designed and implemented microservices architecture using Go",
          "Led team of 5 junior developers",
          "Optimized database queries reducing latency by 40%"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "skills": [
      "Go (Golang)",
      "PostgreSQL",
      "Docker",

- **Content:** Complete JSONB object with summary, experience, and skills
- Content preserved (First 200 chars): "Experienced Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years specializing in Go microservices, distributed systems, and PostgreSQL database design. Proven track record of building scalable architectures..."

---

### Step 5: CRITICAL TEST - Update Document WITHOUT Content Field

**Test Case:** Update only title and status, verify content is NOT overwritten
**Status:** PASS (BUG FIX VERIFIED)

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/documents/da3c511f-99b0-4f95-84e0-e1e10970a5d0`

**Request (No content field):**
```json
{
  "title": "Updated Title - Senior Go Developer",
  "status": "draft"
}
```

**Result:**
- HTTP Status: 200 OK
- Response: `{"message":"Document updated successfully"}`

**Expected Behavior:** Content should be preserved (not set to null)

---

### Step 6: Verify Content Was Preserved (AFTER Update)

**Test Case:** Confirm content still exists after partial update
**Status:** PASS (CRITICAL SUCCESS)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/documents/da3c511f-99b0-4f95-84e0-e1e10970a5d0`

**Result:**

```

**Comparison:**
- Before update: "Experienced Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years..."
- After update: "Experienced Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years..."
- **RESULT:** IDENTICAL - Content preserved successfully

**Verification:**
- experience array: Still contains TechCorp entry with all responsibilities
- skills array: Still contains all 6 skills (Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.)
- summary: Unchanged

**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "final"
}
```

**Result:**
- HTTP Status: 200 OK
- Status changed: "draft" â†’ "final"
- Title unchanged: "Updated Title - Senior Go Developer"
- **Content unchanged:** All experience, skills, summary preserved

---

### Step 8: Update Content Explicitly

**Test Case:** Verify explicit content updates work correctly
**Status:** PASS

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/documents/da3c511f-99b0-4f95-84e0-e1e10970a5d0`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "custom_field": "This is manually edited content",

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Automated Regression Tests (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Recommendation:** Create automated integration tests to prevent this bug from reoccurring.

**Suggested Test Cases:**
```go
func TestUpdateDocumentPartial_PreservesContent(t *testing.T) {
    // Test partial update without content field
    // Verify content is not set to null
}

func TestUpdateDocument_OnlyTitle(t *testing.T) {
    // Update only title field
    // Verify status and content unchanged
}

func TestUpdateDocument_OnlyStatus(t *testing.T) {
    // Update only status field
    // Verify title and content unchanged
}

func TestUpdateDocument_ExplicitContentChange(t *testing.T) {
    // Update with explicit content field
    // Verify content changes, other fields unchanged
}
```

**Location:** `backend/internal/handlers/document_handler_test.go`

---

### 2. Database-Level Content Audit (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Recommendation:** Check production database for any documents that may have lost content due to this bug before the fix.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Find documents with null content that should have content
SELECT id, user_id, type, title, created_at, updated_at
FROM documents
WHERE content IS NULL
  AND type IN ('resume', 'cover_letter')
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';

-- Check if these documents ever had content
SELECT d.id, d.title, COUNT(gh.id) as generation_count
FROM documents d
LEFT JOIN generation_history gh ON gh.document_id = d.id
WHERE d.content IS NULL
GROUP BY d.id, d.title;
```

---

### 3. API Documentation Update (LOW PRIORITY)

**Recommendation:** Document the partial update behavior clearly in API documentation.

**Example:**
```
PUT /api/v1/documents/{id}

Partial updates are supported. Only include fields you want to change.
Fields not included in the request will retain their existing values.

Examples:
- Update only title: {"title": "New Title"}
- Update only status: {"status": "final"}
- Update multiple fields: {"title": "New Title", "status": "draft"}
- Update content: {"content": {...}}
```

---

### 4. Code Review for Similar Patterns (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Recommendation:** Review other update endpoints for similar bugs.

**Endpoints to Check:**
- `PUT /api/v1/profile`
- `PUT /api/v1/profile/experience/{id}`
- `PUT /api/v1/profile/education/{id}`
- `PUT /api/v1/profile/skills/{id}`

**Pattern to Look For:**
```go
// BAD - Overwrites fields with zero values
updateQuery := `UPDATE table SET field1 = $1, field2 = $2 WHERE id = $3`

// GOOD - Only updates provided fields
if req.Field1 != "" {
    updateFields = append(updateFields, "field1 = $"+strconv.Itoa(paramCount))
    params = append(params, req.Field1)
    paramCount++
}
```

---

### 5. User Communication (if applicable)

**If this bug affected production:**
- Notify affected users that the bug has been fixed
- Provide instructions for users who lost content to regenerate documents
- Consider compensating affected users with extra free generations
